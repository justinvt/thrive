Hear from Thrive Families...                    
------------------------------

As parents, we are constantly reminded how important it is to read to our children. I thought I was doing a good job by reading bedtime stories and interacting with my children throughout the day. I have two children (ages 5 and 3) who have been attending Thrive programs for a year now and I can't imagine not sending them. My kids LOVE going to class and Bridget has awakened their curiosity and excitement more than I ever could - and I tried!! They have a new love for letters, language, and reading and it truly is a gift to have this opportunity. Amazing programs and an even more awesome teacher! Thank you for everything!

My son, Kai, finished kindergarten this year.  He was very insecure about reading and it was challenging to get him to practice. In a short time working with Bridget at Thrive he has become a confident and enthusiastic reader.  It has boosted his self esteem tremendously and I am confident that he is prepared for first grade.  I highly recommend Bridget and her program!

My daughters (ages 8 and 7) did the Thrive summer camp this year and they loved it! The teachers made reading fun and the girls were so proud to show me each day what they were learning and working on in camp. I also appreciated the thorough individual assessments of their skills and the take home strategies for us to use to help them become even stronger readers. We will definitely be back again next year!

Although you have been working together for less 4 months, the change in Shaheen’s approach to and outlook on writing has completely changed.  Your strategy of improving not only his technical skills but also his confidence in his writing has already made a notable difference in his ability.  His writing is now not only well planned and executed but also descriptive and expressive.  He is also much happier and does not dread writing assignments.  Importantly, Shaheen’s 5th grade teacher also expressed the following: I asked Shah about his tutor as I was working with him the other day, as he seems to have made remarkable improvement, even in our conferences. … Please let her know that I will be recommending her.

Evan joined Thrive for the summer going into 4th grade.  We could not be more pleased with his progress and we really have to thank Bridget and Erin.  They are so knowledgeable and patient and nurturing and fun and I could go on and on. Evan was reluctant to go because tutoring didn't really seem to be a fun thing to do in the summer but he left every session happy and feeling accomplished.  He not only wanted to practice reading more at home but felt more confident in his writing skills and got some great tips for important skills he will need to use in 4th grade.  Bridget and Erin truly know and understand kids and how to make learning fun!

I just wanted to share this wonderful program with other parents. Bridget and Erin are amazing and are able to really make an impact on your kids in such a short time. My 4-year old has been attending the pre-k classes all summer and his reading and writing skills have improved significantly. I really can't say enough about their patience, creativity and ability to create excitement around learning!
